# Business Intelligence and Analytics  

Dear Students,  

Welcome to the Business Intelligence and Analytics lab sessions! This is your go-to space for developing the skills you’ll need to thrive in this course. Each week’s lab materials—walkthroughs, exercises, data, and solutions—will be provided here, with solutions posted approximately one week after the session.  

Our labs are designed to build both technical and analytical expertise, following this structured format:  

### 1. **Walkthroughs:**  
In the first part of each lab, the TAs will guide you through notebooks that demonstrate practical applications of lecture concepts using Python. These hands-on sessions are designed to help you complete the exercises and assignments effectively. Take detailed notes, ask questions, and stay engaged for maximum benefit.  

### 2. **Exercises:**  
In the second part, you’ll apply the concepts by solving exercises that build on the walkthroughs. You can work individually or in small collaborative groups, depending on your preference. This is an ideal time to ask the TAs questions to deepen your understanding and refine your problem-solving skills.  

### 3. **Lab Assignments:**  
Each lab session includes a weekly assignment with two quiz questions on Moodle (for a total of 20 questions across 10 labs). To earn full points, you must answer 16 out of 20 questions correctly (80%). You can miss up to two labs without penalty, but missed lab activities cannot be made up under any circumstances. The quiz closes at **4:00 PM every Thursday**. You may collaborate on the questions, but each student must submit their own responses individually on Moodle.  

### 4. **Personal Assignment:**  
Once during the semester, you will be assigned a **personal assignment** (Moodle: Python code + Quiz). This assignment is strictly individual, and any detected code similarity between students will result in a grade of zero for all involved parties. Take this assignment as an opportunity to demonstrate your individual progress and analytical thinking.  

### **Support and Questions:**  
If you run into challenges during the lab, don’t hesitate to ask the TAs for help. After the lab, any additional questions should be posted in the Moodle discussion forum. Don’t forget: Google and other online resources are invaluable tools for any coder, so use them to your advantage!  

We look forward to an exciting and productive semester with you.  

**Your BIA TAs**
