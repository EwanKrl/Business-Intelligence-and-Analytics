For the kurtosis, you can use the [`kurtosis()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.kurtosis.html) function. <br>\n",
        "If you want to test the normality of the distribution, you can use tjhe ktest function from the scipy library. For example, to test if the distribution of the Customer_Age column is normal, you can use the following code:\n",

        "The skewness and kurtosis of a normal distribution are respectively 0 and 3. If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical. If the skewness is between -1 and ‚Äì 0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the data are moderately skewed. If the skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1, the data are highly skewed. A negative skewness indicates that the tail on the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter. A positive skewness indicates that the tail on the right side is longer or fatter. The kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers. A uniform distribution would be the extreme case."
